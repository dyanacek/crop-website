<h2 style="text-align: center; color: red">SOME HUNGER FACTS</h2>

<p>According to the latest United Nations report on hunger, one of every six people in this world, one sixth of all humanity, 
suffers from chronic hunger.  That is an increase of 100 million people from this same time last year, bringing the total number 
of people suffering from serious chronic hunger to just over 1 billion people worldwide.  In our own community of Seattle, hunger 
is rising.  Recent reports from local Food Banks all show an unprecedented growth in the need for their services.</p>

<p>When we focus on mortality rates, hunger is never specifically listed.  But it is all too frequently a major contributor to death.</p>

<hr style="color: red; margin-left: 450px; margin-right: 450px" />

<p>According to Jean Ziegler (the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food for 2000 to March 2008), mortality 
due to malnutrition accounted for 58% of the total mortality in 2006: "In the world, approximately 62 millions people, all 
causes of death combined, die each year. In 2006, more than 36 millions died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in micronutrients"</p>

<p>Based on these experts, more people die prematurely from hunger than from all other causes combined.  Yet unlike cancer or AIDS, 
a simple, widely available cure is actually known.</p>

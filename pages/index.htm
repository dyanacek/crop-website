<p style="text-align: center; color: black">CROP Hunger Walks help children and families worldwide -- and right here in the U.S. -- to have food for today, 
while building for a better tomorrow. Each year some two million CROP Walkers, volunteers, and sponsors put their 
hearts and soles in motion, raising over $16 million per year to help end hunger and poverty around the world -- 
and in their own communities. And you are part of it!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: red">OTHER INFORMATION</h2>

<p style="text-align: center; color: black"><img src="dogs_web.jpg" alt=" " height="200"><br/>The first Sunday in October is the traditional feast day for St. Francis of Assisi, Patron Saint of animals and of the environment.  
In keeping with his celebration of all creation and the creatures in it, we encourage you to bring not only your 
human friends for the walk, but, if appropriate, your pets on leash as well.

It is hailed as one of the Pacific Northwest's finest soulful ensembles. Pastor Patrinell Staten Wright started the group as a gospel music class at Seattle's Franklin High School in 1973. Since then the choir has grown to become a nationally and internationally known gospel singing group.

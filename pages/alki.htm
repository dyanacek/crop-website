<p><img src="depth_web.jpg" alt=" " height="500"/>A formal course of 5 kilometers has been laid out from <a href="http://www.alkiucc.org/" target="_blank">Alki Congregational United Church of Christ</a> 
(our host congregation) along the Alki boardwalk towards downtown and then back again.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p><img src="northview_web.jpg" alt=" " height="250"/>The course is flat throughout, and for the most part borders a public waterfront park.  You will pass the historic 
Alki Lighthouse, as well as monuments commemorating the landing of the Denny party on Alki Point in 1851 
(the first settlers in Seattle), and a replica of the Statue of Liberty.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p><img src="alki_web.jpg" alt=" " height="200"/>The views are spectacular, it is common to spot wildlife, 
especially birds such as bald eagles, osprey and blue heron, and every step of the way is fully wheelchair 
(and stroller) accessible.</p>
